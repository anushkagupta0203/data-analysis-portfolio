## 📁 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation (Python)**  
   - Loaded dataset, checked for nulls/duplicates (None found).  

2. **Data Modeling & Analysis (SQL)**

   - Calculated key KPIs (attrition %, tenure, employee count).  

3. **Visualization (Power BI)**  
   - Built 2-page dashboard with KPIs and interactive filters.  
   - Added relationships for dynamic filtering across tables.
